    <h1>How to Get Started as a Designer (Or Become a Better One)</h1>
  
  <div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
  
    <p>One of the hardest parts of starting any new project or learning a new skill can be figuring out how to get started. There are thousands of blog posts, podcasts, and YouTube videos out there claiming to know the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to become a great designer. <strong>Here&rsquo;s the thing, most of them are complete b.s..</strong></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to go sell your firstborn for an Adobe CC license or start waking up at zero dark thirty for creative golden hour. The key to obtaining mastery in anything is <em>purposeful practice</em>. Not all practice is equal, so don&rsquo;t expect to get better by simply repeating the same mistakes over and over. The good news is that it&rsquo;s super easy to set yourself up for success!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By shifting just a few things in the way that you work, you can take your designing to the next level much faster and with less stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-clearly-define-the-skill-you-want-to-learn">1. Clearly define the skill you want to learn.</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes that beginners make is jumping into practice without any real direction. Doing this will simply waste your time and effort. Constantly check in with yourself and ask: do the activities I&rsquo;m doing match the skill I&rsquo;m trying to learn?</p>
<h2 id="2-leave-the-idea-of-perfect-at-the-door">2. Leave the idea of perfect at the door.</h2>
<p>Designers are notorious for being perfectionists bordering on neurotic. While a keen eye for detail is an important quality to have, don&rsquo;t get hung up on making things perfect. Especially when you&rsquo;re just getting started, quantity is just as important as quality. Make things. Do your best. Learn from the mistakes. And keep it moving.</p>
<h2 id="3-read-broadly">3. Read broadly.</h2>
<p>Design is ultimately about people. Understanding why we do the things we do and being able to predict how that will change over time will give you an incredible edge over others. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take inspiration from places that might not be immediately obvious.</p>
<h2 id="4-learn-how-to-sketch">4. Learn how to sketch.</h2>
<p>The most common trap new, and even seasoned, designers fall into is jumping straight into the &ldquo;final&rdquo; design. This literally <em>never</em> works. You&rsquo;ll always end up going back and tweaking or redoing entire sections, and these project often lack quality. Take your time and start out with pen and paper. Your sketches don&rsquo;t need to look like da Vinci&rsquo;s. The goal is to give yourself space to ponder and experiment without having to put much time and effort in.</p>
<h2 id="5-feedback">5. Feedback!</h2>
<p>This is hands down the most important part of this article. <strong>Good feedback loops are absolutely essential to improving your design skills.</strong> Without them, you&rsquo;ll find yourself plateauing more than growing. Find a mentor who is ahead of you in terms of skill and ask them to critique your designs. This can be a friend, professor, co-worker, etc.. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who they so long as they can give you quality feedback on your work.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting good at design is less about tools or theory and more about being intentional in the way that you work. Paying attention to your habits now will give you exponential return in the future. You&rsquo;ll progress faster, plateau less often, and spend less time stressed about how to move forward. Happy designing!</p>
