      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a Taoist parable of a farmer whose horse runs away. When his neighbors find out, they offer condolences for his bad luck. The farmer simply replies &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;rdquo;.

Once again, the neighbors lament the farmer&amp;rsquo;s bad luck only to receive the same reply, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.</description>

      <description>** This work was originally an assignment for my CS 4873: Computing, Society, and Professionalism course at Georgia Tech. **
 Since the first Sumerian city-states were built in the early 4000s BCE, urban landscapes have simultaneously captured the peaks of human ingenuity and the depths of human depravity. Like no other construction, cities capture the ethos and ego of society. They are where the ball is pushed, great debates are had, and the fate of humanity is decided.</description>
