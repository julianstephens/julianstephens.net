<li>Growth of any type is the product of friction.</li>
<li>Change your mind, often.</li>
<li>Information intake should be managed in much the same way as food intake. Getting the right nutrients makes all the difference in the quality of your output.</li>
<li>Experiment often.</li>
<li>Consistent and purposeful practice overtakes natural ability much quicker than you think. Decide early on in an endeavor which route you want to take.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t focus so much on finding a single great mentor. You can achieve the same effects by simply surrounding yourself with people that are smarter than you. Your ego is the only thing stopping you from learning from your peers.</li>
<li>Build your brand. When considering a new opportunity, skill, etc. ask yourself, &ldquo;how will this affect my brand?&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Pick one thing to go deep on and generalize everything else.</li>
<li>Develop a good notetaking system and use it religiously. You should be able to quickly capture ideas, easily search your entire knowledge base, and make connections between similar notes.</li>
<li>Start writing more. It will make you a better thinker and will help you build credibility.</li>
</ol>
