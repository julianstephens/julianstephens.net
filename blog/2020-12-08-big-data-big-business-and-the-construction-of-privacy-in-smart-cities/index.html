<hr>
<p>Since the first Sumerian city-states were built in the early 4000s BCE, urban landscapes have simultaneously captured the peaks of human ingenuity and the depths of human depravity. Like no other construction, cities capture the ethos and ego of society. They are where the ball is pushed, great debates are had, and the fate of humanity is decided. Now as nations sit on the cusp of a future that science fictionists have long prophesized as a defining moment in human morality, they must ask of themselves “What type of power will we be?”. The force driving this great shift is the vaguely defined and often misunderstood smart city.</p>
<p>Contrary to their portrayal in pop culture, smart cities are not authoritarian metropolises ruled by corporate greed and perpetually soaked in pollutant-laden acid rain, though this pessimistic vision is not implausible. The truth is that smart cities capture the attention of experts across a wide array of fields, all of whom have their own definition and vision of what a smart city ought to be. However, there is a consensus that ultimately smart cities are those that utilize technology to better serve their constituents <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Admittedly this is still an extremely broad definition, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>The primary tools used in smart city interventions are information and communication technologies (ICTs). These tools combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used in almost every facet of city governance including managing traffic, voting, waste management, etc. In their research on the use of IoT in smart cities, Ejaz and Anpalagan identified six basic characteristics smart cities have: smart economy, people, governance, mobility, environment, and living <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It is important to note that these characteristics exist on a continuum. A city may excel in smart economics at one point in time only for smart governance to take precedence later.</p>
<p>From the point of view of academia, smart cities seem to be heralds of a better, more equitable future made possible by the technological advances of the last half-century. However, there is a dark side to the normalization of technocratic society. Stripped down, smart cities are made possible by one thing, data. There is no way to build better public transportation systems without collecting data on current usage patterns. Electronic passports require RFID tags and massive databases. This brave new world revolves around the collection, analysis, and storage of incomprehensible amounts of data. It is not just governmental entities that need access to that data. Smart cities almost always require collaboration between the public and private sectors. Thus, the principal challenge of smart cities is not implementation, but security.</p>
<p>The 21st century has made clear that there is a tradeoff between privacy and convenience. Information privacy legislation like the GDPR and HIPPA have attempted to tip the scale back in favor of consumers. However, it is increasingly obvious, especially in the United States, that data privacy remains a largely unregulated arena. This pushes the brunt of the responsibility on consumers who often lack the time and knowledge needed to adequately protect themselves <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The UN predicts that by 2050, almost 70% of the global population will live in urban environments, making this issue a pressing one around the world <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having previously defined a smart city to be one that utilizes technology to better the lives of its citizens, the question then becomes how can a smart city, whose lifeblood is data, truly improve the lives of its citizens without offering any protections for those same people? The remainder of this paper will examine that question in hopes of determining if there exists some way to reconcile these two things without compromising the common morality of society, which is the betterment of human life.</p>
<h2 id="data-privacy-in-smart-cities">Data Privacy in Smart Cities</h2>
<h3 id="history-of-privacy">History of Privacy</h3>
<p>Privacy as it is known today is a relatively new concept. In their seminal 1890 article “The Right to Privacy”, Warren and Brandeis established the current underlying framework on which much of the current discourse around privacy is built. Their article was essentially a reaction to new technologies such as instant photography and the ability to record audio, which presented a then unprecedented threat to the privacy of the individual. Now over a century later, their definition of privacy as “the right to be left alone” is still a sound one <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. However, technology has evolved at a breakneck speed beyond anything that Warren or Brandeis could have imagined in the late 19th century. Their definition may still stand, but the question of what entities individuals are entitled to privacy from has changed drastically.</p>
<p>In the last 130 years since Warren and Brandeis published their article, the United States has seen several shifts in privacy law. Each of these variations has been spurred largely by changes in the foundational sociotechnical systems on which American society operates <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. That the advent of smart cities would also spark such a change is not difficult to see. Going back to the question of whether smart cities can both support and protect their citizens, it seems that the problem does not lay in the fact that existing privacy legislation is inadequate, but that the implementation of these technologies has so far outpaced the reconstruction of the law.</p>
<h3 id="current-privacy-legislation">Current Privacy Legislation</h3>
<p>One might ask, how can there be such a disparity between creation and implementation if new privacy legislation like the GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in California have been recently passed with the same technologies as seen in smart cities in mind? The answer is simple; the difference between truly modern privacy law and the legislation currently in effect is in the distribution of power. Current legislation still operates on the 14th amendment privacy model of the 1970s <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The emphasis lays not on privacy as a means of protection, but on privacy as liberty to be exercised in the form of choice <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This individualist model is known as the “privacy self-management” framework <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The underlying idea behind this framework is that individuals have a right to their data. They should be able to access it, decide who uses it, and be given notice when any other parties are granted access. While this may have been a sound model for the early days of computing and the Internet, it simply cannot handle the sheer amount of data collection that has now become commonplace. Imagine the thousands of sensors, applications, and devices needed to implement even the most basic of smart city technologies over a few dozen square miles. No single person, even an expert, has or should devote the time to monitoring and maintaining access to and usage of that amount of data.</p>
<p>The key to modernizing privacy legislation is not creating clever and complex laws to match the technologies that they are trying to regulate. To have a technologically advanced society that values the data lives of its members, privacy legislation must recognize that individuals are weak <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In the face of thousands of gigabytes of data that a single person will produce in their lifetime, even the most capable lack the resources necessary to thrive in a “privacy self-management” environment. The logical conclusion that must be drawn is that broader bodies and networks of people should hold much of the power so that individuals are free to reap the benefits of the protection such an organization would provide.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-in-the-new-urban-landscape">Privacy in the New Urban Landscape</h3>
<p>It is important to understand the way that data collection in smart cities differs from the data collection done by governments around the world today. Traditionally, the type of data that governments are interested in is time scoped. In other words, the data collection is done over a specified period and then stopped. A good example of this is census data. Smart cities, by contrast, require data collection to occur constantly, indefinitely, and to capture a fine-grained level of detail that is not needed in traditional datasets <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. This is what is known as big data.</p>
<p>Most smart city interventions target the optimization or improvement of existing services like transportation, utilities, or waste management. A prime example is the Centro de Operações da Prefeitura do Rio in Brazil, which utilizes data from dozens of agencies within the city of Rio de Janeiro to react quickly and flexibly to any type of municipal problem that may arise <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. However, in many other cities, civil services are operated primarily by private organizations. Thus, the data collected by those organizations are also considered to be privately owned assets. When cameras are being used to keep track of every vehicle that travels on a major highway or GPS location data is being monitored for every mobile phone user, it becomes extremely difficult for any version of the privacy self-management model to function effectively.</p>
<p>A popular response to the seemingly impossible task of securing the smart city is the “privacy by design” paradigm. The idea is that companies should build privacy measures into the devices and systems that are used to collect the data. Europe’s GDPR parades this framework as the primary means by which private and public actors should achieve compliance with new privacy regulations. Initially, this seems to be a sound strategy. It shifts the data security narrative from a reactive to a proactive one by ensuring the safety of consumers before they ever interact with the product. The GDPR does not, however, provide any practical guidance on how to implement such a design <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Privacy by design could very well be part of the solution to giving citizens peace of mind regarding their data. It could also simply be jargon thrown around by corporate and state actors to mask the fact that data owners have little to no true ownership. Regardless of which track the model follows, the fact remains that no legal guidelines or regulations exist to ensure the quality or even existence of such measures in a system.</p>
<h2 id="the-danger-of-technocracy">The Danger of Technocracy</h2>
<h3 id="power-and-privacy">Power and Privacy</h3>
<p>The role of technology in governance and politics has grown significantly since the advent of Web 2.0 and only continues to do so. Now commonplace is the usage of big data in every possible facet of public life. Despite the obvious infringement on the private sphere of every member of society, the literature around big data focuses almost exclusively on the boundless possibilities offered by what are glorified surveillance states <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Acknowledged or not, the government and Big Business exercise an almost militant control over the lives of consumers that undermines the existing power structures in place.
Smart cities have just as much potential to live up to the expectations of excited researchers as they do to become ground zero for a new kind of colonialism. Even now as postcolonial and decolonial rhetoric fight for traction in popular academia, the potential for data colonialism lurks. Data colonialism presents all the same perils as the colonialism of past centuries combined with the pervasive control that smart cities offer <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. In a state occupied by data colonists, there does not exist one centralized power structure that can be identified and challenged. The nature of big data and smart cities makes it so that colonial power is dispersed across the network of public and state data collectors. Thus, even those that hold power are simultaneously subject to it.</p>
<p>The challenges that legislators now face to prevent such a future are vast and varied. It is not just a matter of policing technology. Late capitalism is a self-flagellating system that threatens to destroy itself even as it prospers. It might be that big data necessitates the move away from free-market economics into some new hybrid model characterized by state control over the amount of power that corporate actors hold.</p>
<h3 id="technological-determinism">Technological Determinism</h3>
<p>Currently, the construction of smart cities is largely dominated by technocrats. While this is not inherently bad, it does offer an explanation as to why there seems to be an inability or unwillingness to acknowledge just how political smart cities are. It seems rather obvious that technologists will find technical solutions to their problems. Again, this is not inherently bad. The issue lays in the fact that as problem spaces scale, so too must their solution spaces.</p>
<p>The idea of technological artifacts being the primary means of social change is known as technological determinism <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Technological determinism leaves little room for human autonomy as a force of social change. It is a naturally attractive theory for technocrats because it supposes that any socioeconomic problem can be reduced to a technical one <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The use of such logic is evident in some of the popular solutions to the issue of security in smart cities. A prime example is the use of blockchain technology as a catchall security measure and a quick fix for the smart city’s vulnerability to corruption <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. However, what this solution and others like it do not address is the fact that technology adoption is largely contextual.</p>
<p>To understand why this is so important, it is helpful to go back to the six characteristics that define smart cities. As previously mentioned, the presence and strength of each of those characteristics in any given smart city is fluid <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Thus, the technologies utilized and the underlying architecture for a smart city are likely to be just as fluid. This is not to say that each smart city will be significantly different in implementation from the others, but there will likely be a handful of archetypes that emerge. Finding a suite of technological solutions in the form of privacy by design or by some other paradigm that suits the adoptive and cultural contexts of every smart city is a futile effort. It is clear that for smart cities to succeed, there must be some way to address their security concerns that is highly contextual and takes into account the reciprocity between said solution and the socioeconomic and political landscapes of the city.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a century’s worth of knowledge that experts have yet to discover on the best way to build and secure smart cities, and another century’s worth of debates on whether that truly is the best answer. Even though this paper’s examination of the current state of preparation for smart cities seems rather dismal, the answer to the question of whether smart cities can simultaneously collect and protect is a resounding yes. To do so, there are a few measures that need to be put in place:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modern privacy legislation that redefines privacy for the era of Web 2.0.</li>
<li>An openness to higher state regulation of the private sector to protect democratic power relationships must be fostered. There is alternatively room for the formation of a neo-democratic model in which new power relationships are forged.</li>
<li>The formation of an agency whose sole focus is providing the same sort of regulation for state actors.</li>
<li>A set of engineering and technical regulations and guidelines should be created to aid those creating smart city technologies.</li>
<li>A new consumer privacy model must be created, in which consumers can group and pool resources to distribute privacy responsibility across the network instead of being individually culpable.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just a preliminary and non-exhaustive approximation of what must occur to ensure the protection of smart citizens.</p>
<p>Some have already begun working on the points listed above. One such proposal is a new type of system architecture in which every programming object is an abstraction of a real object. In addition to holding the physical and methodological properties of that object, it would also carry the same ethical and social context. Known as Ethics-Aware Object-Oriented Smart City Architecture (EOSCA), this framework offers an answer to the fluidity of privacy concerns smart cities face <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Another solution proposes the creation of privacy Trusts in which trustees fight for privacy and data rights on behalf of consumers. This offers an implementation of strong, networked consumer privacy <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that smart cities will be the norm across the world any time soon. However, the use of smart city technologies and big data by state and corporate actors is already here. The time for seriously considering how to create a world that is private, secure, and democratic in the face of pervasive surveillance is now. Should this conversation stagnate, the dystopian corporate authoritarian states popularized by science fiction could quickly become a reality.</p>
