    <h1>Understanding Mental Models and Innovation</h1>
  
  <div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
  
    <h2 id="what-is-a-mental-model">What is a mental model?</h2>
<p>The term mental model comes from Kenneth Craik&rsquo;s book <em>The Nature of Explanation</em>. Craik said that we have internal models of the world that help us in decision-making, problem solving, task performance, and pretty much everything else that we do.</p>
<p>When people interact with the world, they notice patterns and start to anticipate them. <strong>Those patterns then combine and develop into an understanding of how systems function.</strong> That is a mental model.</p>
<h2 id="mental-models-in-design">Mental models in design</h2>
<p>A great example is the way that toddlers interact with touchscreens. They&rsquo;ve been swiping between screens and clicking on apps since before they could talk. After handing one of those children a book, you might notice that they get confused. The kid wants to swipe or tap to interact with book because that&rsquo;s the mental model that they&rsquo;ve formed. It takes some fumbling before they realize that the physical pages have to be picked up and turned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mental models give the designers a path when designing digital interfaces.&rdquo; - Tania Vieira</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re all like those children. We form mental models that tell us how to interact with the world. As a designer, it&rsquo;s important to take existing mental models into account. A popular design principle called Jakob&rsquo;s Law that says users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that they prefer your site to work the same way as those sites that they already know. We can equate Jakob&rsquo;s Law to the age-old maxim &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is where a common misconception that mental models hinder innovation comes into play. If your site is supposed to act like every other site, then where&rsquo;s the room from creativity and evolution? Sticking to mental models doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s no room for innovation. We simply have to redefine it in this context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mental models encapsulate the limitations of the systems that they&rsquo;re attached to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typical definitions of innovation revolve around novelty, but we need to shift the focus a bit. <strong>Designers should view innovation as the process of refining and enhancing existing mental models.</strong> Innovating then becomes about finding ways to better fit users' mental models.</p>
<h2 id="expanding-mental-models">Expanding mental models</h2>
<p>There are times when mental models can and should expand. The important thing is to do so strategically. <strong>Ask yourself, is this going to help my users accomplish their goals? Is it still meeting their behavioral expectations?</strong></p>
<p>Mental models encapsulate the limitations of the systems that they&rsquo;re attached to.  Smartphones in the early 2000s could only be unlocked using a pin or passcode, so that&rsquo;s the mental model that users stored. Technological advancements meant that we could now include fingerprint sensors on phones. Most people were already familiar with using their fingerprint to unlock a door or safe, so it was easy to shift that model onto mobile devices as well. This is a good example of when expanding a mental model allows a new system to perform a similar task with less friction.</p>
<p>The key here is gradual change. Don&rsquo;t throw your users off the deep end on day one and expect them to come back for more. Welcome them with an experience that&rsquo;s comfortable and recognizable. Then, slowly allow them to grow into the changes you have planned. <strong>You want your users to feel empowered when they interact with your design.</strong></p>
<p>Mental models and innovation go hand in hand. Improving as a designer means understanding how they complement each other and how to leverage them together.</p>
