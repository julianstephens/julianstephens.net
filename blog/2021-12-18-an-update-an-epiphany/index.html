  <h1>An Update, An Epiphany</h1>

  <div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
  
    <p>The next decade of my life will be marked by a search for identity as I journey into adulthood, just as the last one has been. So too will the following decades be a continual evolution and affirmation of who I believe myself to be. Having said that, I sense that within the near future I will find myself at a crossroads. In the last two years, I&rsquo;ve watched my karmic path unravel, and it seems that I&rsquo;m fast approaching an end to the first spiritual boot camp I&rsquo;ve been put through. Since the start of 2020, my search for a perennial personal philosophy has intensified both in effort and in commitment. It has led me away from and back to God at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>Growing up in a post-9/11 world, the idea of God has always seemed to me to be either a comforting bedtime story told to the disillusioned or a weapon used to prey upon the masses. The wars of today are fought silently among peaceful suburban streets, just as much as they are in the blatant war zones of the Middle East and the Balkans. What place can God have amid all this? Yet, even in my harshest disbelief, I&rsquo;ve found it difficult to shake the habit of prayer. Laying in bed at night, I&rsquo;ve warred with myself, guilty of sins committed against a being I&rsquo;ve desperately claimed not to believe in. It&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;ve been haunted by the ghosts of someone else&rsquo;s religion.</p>
<p>It was not until I first encountered Ram Dass earlier this year that I began to allow myself the space to reevaluate my faith. In him, I found a type of aching familiarity and attachment that I&rsquo;ve never felt for another being. It baffled me. How could I weep with a sense of personal loss for someone who I&rsquo;ve never known? And yet, I found myself doing just that alone in my apartment with no one around to posture in front of.</p>
<p>Sitting in the dark one evening after watching the beautiful documentary <em>Ram Dass, Going Home</em>, my chest tightened as tears bubbled forth. I couldn&rsquo;t understand what had moved me quite so profoundly. While touching, the film was not a sad one, and my tears came not from a place of melancholy but of powerful and profound longing. I could sense his presence next to me, and I wanted nothing more than to be able to reach out and touch his corporeal being. It was as if, in another life, we had shared the kind of close camaraderie of a student and guru, and it was only now that I was able to mourn the loss.</p>
<p>Since that night, I&rsquo;ve reopened myself to the idea of God and mysticism. While not a regular practitioner, I&rsquo;ve begun to create for myself a new type of spiritual practice. I&rsquo;ve also found religion to be the unifying junction of my philosophical musings. For years, I had rejected even the thought of religion in conjunction with rigorous academic practice. And now, I find it to be the an inseparable part of how I believe the world functions and how it should progress.</p>
<p>This entire evolution has taught me many things. The most significant of which being deep compassion for myself and for others. We are all on our own karmic journeys, and it no less difficult for anyone else than for ourselves. As I prepare to meet this milepost in my course, I&rsquo;m sure that the strength of my spirituality, whatever it may be, will be imperative to the path I tread next.</p>
