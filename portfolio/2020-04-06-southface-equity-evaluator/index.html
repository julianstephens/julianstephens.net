    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Southface is a nonprofit organization that focuses on the tools, technology, and policy that help create sustainable communities. One of the tools that they&rsquo;ve created is the Equity Evaluator. Originally an Excel workbook, the Equity Evaluator helps organizations understand how their developments impact the surrounding communities. You can view it live <a href="https://equityevaluator.southface.org/" title="Southface Equity Evaluator">here</a>!</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to turn the Equity Evaluator into a modern web application. This would make it easier for Southface to distribute and monetize the tool. It also allowed for a new category of users to emerge. With the tool online for anyone to utilize, individuals and neighborhood Homeowner Associations could also use it to ensure that any changes they make to their communities are equitable.</p>
<h3 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>I worked together with a team of five undergrad computer science students over the course of two semesters for our junior design project. I acted as a full stack designer, completing the UX, front-end, and middleware pieces of the project. I also led team and client meetings as the project manager.</p>
<h3 id="scope-and-constraints">Scope and Constraints</h3>
<p>Halfway through the second semester of the project, we were forced to move into remote work environment due to COVID-19. This shift and the circumstances around it set us back several weeks in our planned schedule. As a result, I worked with Southface to adjust the release schedule and to reevaluate the most important features for the Equity Evaluator.</p>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>At the start of the project, we didn&rsquo;t have any background information on Southface or the Equity Evaluator. We met with Equity Evaluator team to get a better understanding the project requirements. I created a list of questions to determine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the goal of the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who the current and expected users are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what their vision for the minimum viable product looks like</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After our initial meeting, I developed a brief PRD and sent it to Southface for review.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="//images.ctfassets.net/skkcb7wqibsg/4hGN0Lm7f3urOUou1mhQX6/2e7ce41831de3ee8045eed36a142c4c9/prd-mock.png" alt="Southface PRD"  />
</p>
<h3 id="user-research">User Research</h3>
<p>With a better idea of what the project entailed, we collected survey data from 12 current users of the tool. From that data, we determined the primary pain points for users in the existing tool.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigation: The main workflow was spread out over several sheets in the workbook. This meant users had to click back and forth to complete the evaluation</li>
<li>Learning: The original tool was extremely difficult to understand how to use. Users weren&rsquo;t sure what to input and where. They didn&rsquo;t understand what sections were applicable to their developments or how to fill out those sections.</li>
<li>Iteration: Southface employees and external users lamented the fact that any time updates to the tool were made, an entirely new Excel workbook had to be created and distributed. They wanted those changes to be as frictionless as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-flow">Task Flow</h3>
<p>I created a task flow diagram to capture the necessary screens and actions after a user logs in to the application.
<img loading="lazy" src="//images.ctfassets.net/skkcb7wqibsg/32PuG1B09lekyrnJ5XAekm/2e0463f0bae32ce276cb9148a2f06a07/Equity_Evaluator_Task_Flow.png" alt="Southface Task Flow"  />
</p>
<h3 id="mockups-feedback-and-iteration">Mockups, Feedback, and Iteration</h3>
<p>Due to time constraints and assignment due dates, I moved directly into high fidelity mockups after collecting user research. My primary focus was on creating a design that addressed the issues users' pain points without straying too far from the mental model that they employ when using Excel.</p>
<p>We presented our initial mockups to Southface and got feedback from the Equity Evaluator team. We also had the opportunity to complete heuristic evaluations with other junior design teams in our class.</p>
<p>Since the users spend most of their time editing projects, I spent the most time optimizing that screen. I came up with two final designs to pick between. We spoke with our clients at Southface and had our classmates test both designs with some simple usage scenarios.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="//images.ctfassets.net/skkcb7wqibsg/2XBwDXwa7gFesFWt5ZLXPG/928d086d5767064feb0d711f1d93a5ec/table-comparison.png" alt="Southface Project View"  />

In the end, we went with the design on the right for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The simplified header makes <em>navigation</em> between the different tables easier on different device sizes.</li>
<li>The project information bar in the header gives users a better sense of where they are in the application.</li>
<li>The export function is more relevant to the project report screen.</li>
<li>The sidebar allows users to <em>keep track of which action items they&rsquo;ve allocated points for</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second most important screen in the application is the project report. This is where the user sees their point total across all of the tables, uploads documents, and exports a PDF of the report. While it is a key screen in the main task flow, this screen doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of actual content that goes on it. The most important element is the graph that shows the score breakdown.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to use a pie chart because it&rsquo;s more aesthetically pleasing than a bar graph. However, I noticed as I mocked up the graph that it was a little confusing to read. I did some research on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" title="Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods">graphs</a> and learned that the shape of pie charts often leads to discrepancy in data interpretation. As such, I switched to a bar graph, which is easier to read and interpret.</p>

</p>
<p>After nailing down the two screens essential to the MVP, I focused on the remainder of the application. These screens all revolved around simplicity. Due to time constraints, we weren&rsquo;t able to extensively test them, but we did make minor tweaks before the development phase.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>With our design set, we moved into the development phase of the project. We decided to use Laravel, a PHP web framework, and Vagrant to make the handoff easier at the end of the project. On the front-end, I used the Laravel templating engine Blade along with the CSS preprocessor Sass. In the middleware, I used PHP to create a RESTful API for Laravel&rsquo;s MVC framework. Check out our Github repo <a href="https://github.com/andrewjohnston99/SouthfaceEquityEvaluator" title="Southface Equity Evaluator Github Repo">here</a>!</p>
<h3 id="outcomes-and-lessons">Outcomes and Lessons</h3>
<p>This project gave me <strong>a lot of confidence in myself</strong> as a designer, developer, and team leader. During the first semester of the project, I was far more likely to let questions that I had for our clients go unanswered. This meant that we had to spend time later on meeting with Southface clarifying how features should be implemented instead of developing.</p>
<p>I also gained a greater appreciation for <strong>simplicity in design</strong>. Southface gave us free reign over the design of the web app, and it was tempting to create something hypermodern and aesthetic. However, I realized that in order for the application to cater to as many users as possible it needed to be functional and familiar.</p>
