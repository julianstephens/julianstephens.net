      <description>The next decade of my life will be marked by a search for identity as I journey into adulthood, just as the last one has been. So too will the following decades be a continual evolution and affirmation of who I believe myself to be. Having said that, I sense that within the near future I will find myself at a crossroads. In the last two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched my karmic path unravel, and it seems that I&amp;rsquo;m fast approaching an end to the first spiritual boot camp I&amp;rsquo;ve been put through.</description>

      <title>On Truth</title>

      <description>There are a lot of things that I used to know for a fact. The older I get, the more inclined I am to adopt a position of scientific ambivalence. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and unlearned so many things over the last decade that I can only assume the pursuit of absolutes is a fickle one.
There does, however, appear to be at least one objective truth that holds across time. Human nature itself is the ultimate source of bias.</description>

      <title>Design Resources</title>

      <description>I get asked all the time what resources I used to get better as a designer. After years of giving a different answer every time, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally compiled a &amp;ldquo;definitive&amp;rdquo; list of books, tools, and courses that I&amp;rsquo;ve used or been recommended during my design journey. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to update this list as I find more or better resources, so be sure to bookmark and check back periodically for changes.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a Taoist parable of a farmer whose horse runs away. When his neighbors find out, they offer condolences for his bad luck. The farmer simply replies &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;rdquo;. Soon the horse returns with four more horses, and when this time he is praised for his good luck, the farmer replies &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&amp;rdquo; The farmer&amp;rsquo;s son sets to work breaking in the horses but falls and breaks his leg. Once again, the neighbors lament the farmer&amp;rsquo;s bad luck only to receive the same reply, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.</description>

      <title>Big Data, Big Business, and the Construction of Privacy in Smart Cities</title>

      <description>** This work was originally an assignment for my CS 4873: Computing, Society, and Professionalism course at Georgia Tech. **
 Since the first Sumerian city-states were built in the early 4000s BCE, urban landscapes have simultaneously captured the peaks of human ingenuity and the depths of human depravity. Like no other construction, cities capture the ethos and ego of society. They are where the ball is pushed, great debates are had, and the fate of humanity is decided.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m coming up on my last semester of my undergrad degree, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reflecting on my time at Georgia Tech. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things that I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back and tell 18 year-old me.
  Growth of any type is the product of friction. Change your mind, often. Information intake should be managed in much the same way as food intake. Getting the right nutrients makes all the difference in the quality of your output.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mental Models and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://julianstephens.net/blog/2020-04-06-understanding-mental-models-and-innovation/</link>

      <description>What is a mental model? The term mental model comes from Kenneth Craik&amp;rsquo;s book The Nature of Explanation. Craik said that we have internal models of the world that help us in decision-making, problem solving, task performance, and pretty much everything else that we do.
When people interact with the world, they notice patterns and start to anticipate them. Those patterns then combine and develop into an understanding of how systems function.</description>
