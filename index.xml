      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a Taoist parable of a farmer whose horse runs away. When his neighbors find out, they offer condolences for his bad luck. The farmer simply replies &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;rdquo;. Soon the horse returns with four more horses, and when this time he is praised for his good luck, the farmer replies &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&amp;rdquo; The farmer&amp;rsquo;s son sets to work breaking in the horses but falls and breaks his leg. Once again, the neighbors lament the farmer&amp;rsquo;s bad luck only to receive the same reply, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.</description>

      <description>** This work was originally an assignment for my CS 4873: Computing, Society, and Professionalism course at Georgia Tech. **
 Since the first Sumerian city-states were built in the early 4000s BCE, urban landscapes have simultaneously captured the peaks of human ingenuity and the depths of human depravity. Like no other construction, cities capture the ethos and ego of society. They are where the ball is pushed, great debates are had, and the fate of humanity is decided.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m coming up on my last semester of my undergrad degree, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reflecting on my time at Georgia Tech. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things that I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back and tell 18 year-old me.

      <title>Understanding Mental Models and Innovation</title>

      <description>What is a mental model? The term mental model comes from Kenneth Craik&amp;rsquo;s book The Nature of Explanation. Craik said that we have internal models of the world that help us in decision-making, problem solving, task performance, and pretty much everything else that we do.
When people interact with the world, they notice patterns and start to anticipate them. Those patterns then combine and develop into an understanding of how systems function.</description>
